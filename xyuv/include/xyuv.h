// High level classes and structs.
// The declaration of these structures can be found under include/xyuv/structures

//! A choma siting struct holds the necessary parameters to describe a sub-sampling operation.
//! e.g. YUV-420 or YUV-422
struct chroma_siting;

//! A conversion matrix holds the parameters to describe an RGB <-> YUV conversion.
struct conversion_matrix;

//! A format template holds the generic parameters to describe a specific pixel-format.
//! i.e. Formulas to describe line stride, pixel-packing etc.
struct format_template;

//! A format describes the pixel-format and layout of a single frame. A format holds all the meta-data for a frame,
//! everything from frame dimensions to pixel-packing, chroma-siting and rgb conversion.
//! A format is usually created from combining image_w, and image_h, a format-template, a conversion matrix and a
//! chroma siting descriptor.
struct format;

//! A frame is the realisation of a format together with raw-pixel data.
struct frame;

//! A yuv image is the intermediate representation of an image. Stored in a high precision internal format.
struct yuv_image;

//! An rgb image is an interface-class to simplify interaction of libxyuv to other image libraries.
